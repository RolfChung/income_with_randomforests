# income_with_randomforests

<p>
This project is predicting income with random forest models using 
<a href= "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html">
scikit learn.</a> Random Forests are still state of the art
algorithms for binary classification.
</p>
<p>
The project is using the RandomForestClassifier, fits different forest models and makes predictions. It is applying metrics like accuracy and auc. It is also adopting train-test-splits, decision tree visualization with export_graphviz, cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning with grid search.
</p>
<p>
The data set is taken from the

Systems</a>.
